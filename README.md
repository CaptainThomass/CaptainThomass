- 👋 Hi, I’m @CaptainThomass (Thomás Matos)
- 👀 I’m interested in Gaming programming
- 🌱 I’m currently learning .GML
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing
- 📫 How to reach me ... (I don't know it meant to be)

I'm Brazilian, 15, and I want to create a game on my own (I know, it's hard, but I'll not give up).
I don't know English. My English fluency is almost nothing (maybe I've already written something wrong here).
I hope I learn here something 'cause .GML is too different between Js.
